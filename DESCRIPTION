Description: Application of theoretical results which ensure that the summation
  of an infinite discrete series is within an arbitrary margin of error of its
  true value. The C code under the hood is shared through header files to allow
  users to sum their own low level functions as well. Based on the paper by
  Braden (1992) <doi: 10.2307/2324995>.
